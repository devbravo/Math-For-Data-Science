    "**Probability** is how strongly we believe an event will happen, often expressed as a percentage. Probabilty is often expressed as a percentage, as in \"There is a 70% chance my flight will be late.\" We will call this probability P(X)\n",

    "**Likelihood** is measuring the frequency of events that already occurred. \n",

    "Another distrinction between probability and lilkelihood is that probability is a value between 0 and 1, while likelihood can be any positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, probability can be expressed as an odds O(x) such as 7:3, 7/3, or 2.333\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn an odds O(X) into a proportional probability P(X), use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X) = \\frac{O(X)}{1 + O(X)}$$\n",
